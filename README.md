# Hello World

Once upon a time, in a place far far away, lived a developer who was struggling to make
semantic versioning work for his project. He tried many libraries and tools to allow
him to semantically and automatically version his project. Alas, none of them worked
as he wanted.

One fine night, he came across this tool called "standard-version". It seemed to 
behave like any other tool he had tried earlier but after reading the documentation,
he realized that it is very close to the tool he wanted. It was not perfect but very
close to it.
