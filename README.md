# Hello World

Once upon a time, in a place far far away, lived a developer who was struggling to make
semantic versioning work for his project. He tried many libraries and tools to allow
him to semantically and automatically version his project. Alas, none of them worked
as he wanted.

One fine night, he came across this tool called "standard-version". It seemed to 
behave like any other tool he had tried earlier but after reading the documentation,
he realized that it is very close to the tool he wanted. It was not perfect but very
close to it.

So, he started using this tool. While he was using it, he noticed this tool only 
bumped patch version regardless of the types mentioned in commit message. "Fuck!", he
shouted. "Why the fuck would the create this exception when you are working on new
project that has version < 1.0.0" he thought to himself. Fortunately, there was an
easy fix. 

Well, that fix did not work. This brought him back to the drawing board and made him
rethink his approach. "May be my requirements are unique enough that these tools 
are not sufficient individually.", he thought. He then realized he could use
functions he needed from more than one tool. 

He dusted off the tool, semtag, he had discarded earlier and tweaked 
semantic-version. He put those two tools together to see what happens.
